favorite parts of robotics are:
- bling
- scouting

I've worked on:
 - NEMESIS Elevator (2024)
 - Bling/Driver Communication
  - Fbling (2024-2025) (short for Fancy Bling) is a python script to display and create fancy light shows to be displayed on robots.
  - Java fBling (2024, Unfinished) was supposed to run those fancy light shows on robots but due to performance issues and the lack of light strips on the robot, it was never used.
  - Bling (2025) Supports WPILib LEDPatterns, Easy Driver Communication, and shows created by fBling. 
- Scouting-Tools (2024-2025)
   - A collection of various tools that'll help with random scouting things.
   - Includes:
      -  Scouting match assigner
      -  Data sanitizer
      - and more
- Orpheus (2024-2025)
   - A website that displays, graphs, and helps you analyze your team's scouting data
   - You choose what data is important for you to look at
   - (should) support any team's data

I'm the scoutmaster for Spartronics for 2025 and 2026.
I'm also the 2026 programming subteam captain.
