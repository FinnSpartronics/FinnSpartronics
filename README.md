favorite parts of robotics are:
- bling
- scouting

Projects I've worked on:
 - NEMESIS Elevator (2024)
 - fBling (2024, Unfinished)
   - Infix to postfix math evaluator
   - Fancy bling (LED) code allowing for complicated light shows
   - Suffered from poor preformance on the robot but ran great on the python simulator I wrote
- Orpheus (2024-2025)
   - A website that displays, graphs, and helps you analyze your team's scouting data
   - You choose what data is important for you to look at
   - (should) support any team's data
