favorite parts of robotics are:
- bling
- scouting

Projects I've worked on for Spartronics:
2024 Season:
 - NEMESIS Elevator Code (2024)
 - fBling (2024, Unfinished)
   - Infix to postfix math evaluator
   - Fancy bling (LED) code allowing for complicated light shows
   - Suffered from poor preformance on the robot but ran great on the python simulator I wrote
2024 Offseason:
- Orpheus (Mostly done, not quite)
  - A better way to look at your scouting data
  - Easy to use UI
  - Somewhat customizable
  - Works with most data
  - Works with TheBlueAlliance and Desmos APIs to display and graph even more information
