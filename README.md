Spartronics scoutmaster and programming captain

| Grade | Game/Year | Spartronics' Robot | What I did this year |
| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| Freshman year | 2024 Crescendo | NEMESIS | I worked on the Elevator subsystem and wrote code for LED light strips that went unused due to NEMESIS never getting light strips (the robot caught on fire) |
| Sophomore year | 2025 Reefscape | EPHYRA | I focused primarily on scouting this year, building up tools for future seasons, building connections and scouting alliances with other teams, and overall revolutionalized all aspects of Spartronics scouting. On the roobt, I wrote the LED light code that was used for Driver Communication and general whimsy from our first competition to the District Championships. I also made a Command that automatically rotated the robot to face the correct direction, such as a reef face for scoring or the coral station for intaking. |
| Junior year | 2026 Rebuilt |  | So far this year, I have built a new scouting app and continued my work on scouting. I have worked on various training resources and led most of the lessons for teaching new programmers. |

I've worked on:
 - NEMESIS Elevator (2024)
 - Bling (LED Lights)/Driver Communication
  - Fbling (2024-2025) (short for Fancy Bling) is a python script to display and create fancy light shows to be displayed on robots.
  - Java fBling (2024, Never finished) was supposed to run those fancy light shows on our robots but due to performance issues and the lack of light strips on NEMESIS, it was never used. This idea was later successfully implemented on EPHYRA.
  - Bling (2025 Reefscape) Supports WPILib LEDPatterns, Easy Driver Communication, and shows created by fBling. 
- Scouting-Tools (2024-Now)
   - A collection of various tools that'll help with random scouting things.
   - Includes:
      - Scouting match assigner
      - Data sanitizer
      - and more
- Orpheus (2024-Now)
   - A website that displays, graphs, and helps you analyze your team's scouting data
   - You choose what data is important for you to look at
   - (should) support any team's data
- Eurydice (2025-Now) Our internal, closed-source scouting app made in Appsheet

I was the 2025 Reefscape scoutmaster (scouting lead) and I will be continuing this role for 2026 Rebuilt
I'm also the 2026 programming subteam captain.
